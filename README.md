Preamble
The purpose of this project is to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) navigation system that addresses the challenges of navigating complex indoor environments such as malls or office buildings. The system will utilize image processing and computer vision techniques to provide real-time directions and information overlaid on a smartphone screen. Students will engage in hands-on development, applying computational and creative thinking skills to design and implement the AR navigation system

Objective
To create an AR navigation system designed for complex indoor environments such as malls and office buildings. The system will use image processing and computer vision techniques to provide real-time directional guidance and overlay information on a smartphone screen. Students will design and implement the system, evaluate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, and identify and address any performance issues or limitations encountered during development.

Partial Specifications
- Input: Live video feed from a smartphone camera.
- Processing: Real-time image recognition of indoor markers and spatial mapping for navigation.
- Output: AR directions displayed on the smartphone screen.
